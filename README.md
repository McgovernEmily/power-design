This program will take a json list of numbers. Then it will ask the user what sub-array they want to find the average in.
Next, the program will use the sub-array the user gave and find the highest average out of the
whole list of numbers.
Gave me skills in continuing how to use Python in creative ways. I also developed a skill in using pseudocode before I programmed my idea in Python. 
I continued to gain skills in using asserts throughout my program to help catch mistakes or bugs.
